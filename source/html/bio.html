            Keith loaded up his Geo Metro and took his comedy nationwide performing at comedy clubs from coast to coast and nearly everywhere in between. He was on the road an average of 44 weeks out of the year performing at clubs all across the country.

Keith has opened in concert for Joan Rivers, Jim Gaffigan, Jeff Foxworthy, Trace Adkins, Sinbad, Gladys Knight, Frank Caliendo, Lewis Black, Little Big Town, Joel McHale, and many more.
